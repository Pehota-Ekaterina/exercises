Dancing bears
Painted wings
Things I almost remember,
And a song someone sings
once upon a december
Someone holds me safe and warm,
horses prance through a silver storm,
Figures dancing gracefully,
across my memory,

Someone holds me safe and warm,
horses prance through a silver storm,
Figures dancing gracefully,
across my memory,
Far away, long ago
things I yern to remember
and a song someone sings
Once upon a December
And a song someone sings
Once upon a December
